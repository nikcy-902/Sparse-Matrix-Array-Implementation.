# Sparse-Matrix-Array-Implementation.
C++ implementation of Sparse Matrix using Array'
# Sparse Matrix Representation using Arrays in C++

## 📌 Description
This project implements an **Array-based representation of Sparse Matrices in C++**.  
A sparse matrix is a matrix that contains mostly zero elements. Storing all elements wastes memory, so this implementation stores **only the non-zero elements** using arrays, making the program memory-efficient.

---

## ✅ Features
- Stores only non-zero elements.
- Represents a sparse matrix using a compact array structure.
- Displays the sparse matrix in tabular format.
- Simple and easy-to-understand C++ implementation.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C++** (Standard Template Library)

---

## ▶️ How to Run
Follow these steps to run the program on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sparse-Matrix-Array-Implementation.git
